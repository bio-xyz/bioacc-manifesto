Combined, we are charting a new path to bio singularity, a transformative convergence that redefines life itself. From CRISPR 2.0 and AI-driven protein design in the near term, to whole genome synthesis and bio-digital interfaces in the mid-term, to de-extinction and synthetic ecosystems in the long-term, and ultimately to biological superintelligence and interspecies communication, we will blur the boundaries between natural and artificial, human and machine, Earth and cosmos.
