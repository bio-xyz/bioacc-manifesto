1.&nbsp;DECENTRALIZE biopower

Harness decentralized networks for data storage, transactions and fundraising to build global collectives that fund, coordinate and commercialize scientific research outside the traditional gates and keepers. Build network states with novel regulatory frameworks for safe, open clinical trials.

2.&nbsp;ENGINEER ethical evolution

Biosafety and accountability can be built into the foundations of our technologies through smart contracts. These create immutable records that enable privacy but allow selective disclosure. Communities can define which gene sequences are considered pathogenic and enforce safety parameters. Smart contracts automate fail-safe measures and governance protocols, ensuring rapid response to risks. By leveraging encryption, onchain governance and consensus we create networks where innovation thrives within transparent, community-driven safety standards.

3.&nbsp;ALIGN with ecological blueprints

Integrate biotechnology to be compatible with the natural ecosystems we have neglected,Â  exploited to the brink of collapse. Embrace the tenets of biomimicry, drawing inspiration from nature's ingenuity, forms, processes, and systems to propel us forward. Openly design new intelligent life forms that eat plastic, reduce carbon dioxide, and multiply plant life.

4.&nbsp;HACK health, claim mind-body liberty

Assert the inalienable right of all sentient beings to explore and expand their own minds and bodies; to optimize their own neurochemistry and cognition as they see fit. Develop and disseminate new tools for safe and effective self-experimentation of nootropics and psychedelics, from open-source brain-computer interfaces to decentralized patient data-collection. Empower and democratize longevity to prevent declining populations.

5.&nbsp;OPEN-SOURCE the code, spread the wealth

Build a global public commons for research, from genomes to drug designs to experimental protocols, with new decentralized intellectual property frameworks and economic models to ensure the fruits of collective intelligence are shared equitably for the benefit of humanity, not hoarded and monetized by a few, decentralizing IP powered by zero knowledge proofs. Develop instruments that record digital and physical science on distributed file systems. The code of life is a public good, not a trade secret.

6.&nbsp;ACCELERATE supply chains

Develop direct-to-consumer supply chains that radically reduce the cost and time to market. Coordinate global biomanufacturing into open markets and enable access for novel innovation, generics, and existing treatments. 3D print molecules locally.
